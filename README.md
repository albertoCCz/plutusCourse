# plutusCourse
In this repository I will be uploading some lecture notes I take while studying and also some complementary material I find useful to follow the Course.

The repo is divided in weeks, as this is the structure of the Plutus Pioneer Program. At each week's directory you can find:
- The LectureXX.md: Lecture notes for the XX week
- The HomeworkX-Done.md: Exercises of the week completed

There is also a "papers" folder where you can find different material: IOHK's papers, Haskell reference books, etc.
